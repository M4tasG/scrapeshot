- Save the links that were already scraped
    - CSV file?
    - JSON file?
    - Shared DB for multiple scrapers?

- Options to scrape
    - Random links
    - Ordered links (https://prnt.sc/[a-z-0-9][a-z-0-9][etc.])
    - Amount of links (Random 100, Random 10000, Ordered 10)

+ Find out why some images that are saved are showing as unsupported or corrupted
    - Images that are showing up like that are coming from imgur, and are the default imgur image not found images
    for some reason some of them save properly while others do not, but for now all recorded cases are 100% imgur
    links. Until a better solution is impletemented, imgur links are being filtered out completely.
- Edge-Cases (currently only one that is being handled if a picture has been removed)
- Threading

- Possibly included image recognition to categorize the scraped images
    - Detect documents, chats, game screenshots etc. (very big ?)
    + Filter out no longer available images
        + Template matching function works with the images that come from imgur which are no longer available, but due to
        filtering out imgur images completely, template matching is unnecessary for now.
